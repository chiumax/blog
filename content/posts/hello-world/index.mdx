i've been thinking about building a blog for a while now to:

- share & deconstruct my thoughts
- have a list of things i've learned
- remember the interesting things i can talk about

it's so loud inside my head. hopefully this'll quiet it down a bit...

addendum (12/1/2022):

i was writing earlier today and felt a rush of emotions. i recommend others try it out. it's a great way to get in touch with yourself and reflect on what happened. it's very different than thinking about it in your head. makes one become more rational
